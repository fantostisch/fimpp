Dear Princess Celestia: Letter about the Fourth Power.

I learned about the fourth power with Twilight Sparkle:
	Did you know Flash Sentry likes Twilight Sparkle?
	Flash Sentry did the product of Twilight Sparkle and Flash Sentry!
	Spike did the product of Twilight Sparkle and Flash Sentry!
	Princess Luna did the product of Twilight Sparkle and Spike!

	Did you know Twilight Sparkle likes the number zero?
	Did you know Flash Sentry likes Twilight Sparkle?
	Did you know Spike likes Twilight Sparkle?
That's about the fourth power with Princess Luna.

Today I learned:
	Did you know Applejack likes the number two?

	I did this 20 times:
		Pinkie Pie did the fourth power of Applejack.
		I wrote: Pinkie Pie!
		Applejack got one more.
	That's what I did!
Your faithful student, Jared MF.
