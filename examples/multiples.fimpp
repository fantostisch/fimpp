Dear Princess Celestia: Letter about Multiples.

I learned about multiples with Princess Luna:
	Did you know Rarity likes the number one?
	Did you know Spike likes Rarity?
	Did you know Twilight Sparkle likes Spike?

	Spike got one more, because he is Twilight Sparkle's sidekick.
	Twilight Sparkle got two more, because she is the leader of the Mane 6.

	Did you know Discord likes Rarity, Spike, and Twilight Sparkle?
	Discord made the dictionary of Discord!

	I did this while Princess Luna was not equal to 0:
		I wrote: Discord!
		On the first page of Discord I read about Rarity.
		Rarity got one more.
		On the first page of Discord I wrote what I knew about Rarity.

		On the second page of Discord I read about Spike.
		Spike got two more, because he is Twilight Sparkle's sidekick.
		On the second page of Discord I wrote what I knew about Spike.

		On the third page of Discord I read about Twilight Sparkle.
		Twilight Sparkle got three more, because she is the leader of the Mane 6.
		On the third page of Discord I wrote what I knew about Twilight Sparkle.

		Princess Luna got one fewer.
	That's what I did!
That's about multiples.

Today I learned how this works:
	I made multiples of 200!
Your faithful student, Jared MF.
