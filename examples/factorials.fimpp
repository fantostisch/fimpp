Dear Princess Celestia: Letter about Factorials.

I learned about the factorial with Spike:
	By the way, this function will return a factorial of Spike's number.

	Did you know that Sweetie Belle likes Spike?
	I did this while Spike had more than the number one:
		Spike got one fewer.
		Sweetie Belle did the product of Sweetie Belle and Spike!
	That's what I did.
That's about the factorial with Sweetie Belle!

Today I learned:
	Did you know that Rarity likes the number one?
	I did this 20 times:
		Twilight Sparkle did the factorial of Rarity.
		I wrote: Twilight Sparkle!
		Rarity got one more.
	That's what I did!
Your faithful student, Jared MF.
